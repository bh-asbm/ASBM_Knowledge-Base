## Identify
- White, powdery salts on surface; often appears after wetting/drying cycles.
- Check **water pathways**: grade, flashing, capillary paths, irrigation overspray.

## Clean
1. Dry brush or low-pressure wash.
2. Use a manufacturer-approved efflorescence cleaner (mild acid blend) — test area first.
3. Rinse thoroughly; avoid driving water behind the facade.

## Prevent
- Fix moisture sources and drainage first.
- Prefer **breathable** sealers for exterior masonry.
- Avoid non-breathable films over damp substrates.

**Field note:** Repeat blooms mean moisture is still entering. Solve the water first.
