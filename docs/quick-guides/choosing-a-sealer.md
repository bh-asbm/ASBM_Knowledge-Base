## Decision Path (3 steps)

1. **Surface**: {"concrete | dense brick | porous CMU | stone"}  
2. **Goal**: {"repel water | enhance color | add sheen | reduce dust | resist stains"}  
3. **Constraints**: {"wet look allowed? | slip risk | VOC limits | traffic load"}

### Rules of Thumb
- **Penetrating** (silane/siloxane) → keeps appearance natural; best for breathable water repellency on masonry/CMU/brick.  
- **Film-forming** (acrylic/urethane) → adds **sheen** and color pop; may reduce breathability; consider slip resistance.  
- **High-traffic** floors → prefer penetrating or tough film with grit additive and defined recoat cycles.

### Spec Box
- **Breathability:** Needed for exterior masonry.  
- **Slip:** Add grit or pick penetrating.  
- **Sheen:** Penetrating = none; Acrylic = low to high.  
- **VOC:** Check regional limits.
