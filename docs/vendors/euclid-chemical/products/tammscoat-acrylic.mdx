## Summary
A breathable acrylic elastomeric for above-grade masonry and concrete where hairline crack-bridging and color uniformity matter.

## Key Specs (fast read)
- **Finish:** Satin to matte, tintable
- **Elongation:** ~200–400% (verify current TDS)
- **Perm rating:** Breathable class (verify)
- **Recoating:** Typically 4–24 hrs; ambient dependent

## Coverage & Yield
- Typical: **125–200 sf/gal/coat**
- Porous CMU may require primer and higher consumption.

> **Estimator tip:** For split-face CMU, start at the low end and add ~15% waste.

## Surface Prep
1. Clean (avoid forcing water behind facade)
2. Repair cracks >1/16" with compatible materials
3. Prime chalky or highly porous substrates

## Application
- Airless ~0.019–0.023" tip, 2500–3000 psi
- Two coats in opposing directions
- Ambient/substrate >50°F and rising; no rain until cured

## Safety & Compliance
Review SDS; observe regional VOC limits.
