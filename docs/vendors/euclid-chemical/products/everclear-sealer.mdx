## Summary
A film-forming acrylic curing/sealing compound for concrete that enhances color and provides sheen. For masonry facades where **breathability** is paramount, consider penetrating systems instead.

## Key Specs (fast read)
- **Sheen:** Low to high depending on solids
- **Use:** Cure new concrete and/or seal existing
- **Slip:** Consider grit in wet areas
- **Recoats:** As directed by TDS; avoid over-application (whitening risk)

## Coverage & Yield
Typical **250–400 sf/gal** depending on porosity and finish.

## Notes
- Avoid trapping moisture; do not apply to damp substrates unless TDS permits.
- Check compatibility if planning future coatings.

**Last reviewed:** 2025-09-28 • _Internal use only. Always defer to current TDS/SDS._
