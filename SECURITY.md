## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please open a [GitHub Security Advisory](https://github.com/bh-asbm/ASBM_Knowledge-Base/security/advisories/new). We aim to respond to all legitimate reports within 3 business days.

All reports will be kept confidential until a fix is released. We will work with you to understand the issue and address it as quickly as possible. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will credit you (unless you request otherwise) in the release notes.
Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

## Disclosure Policy

We request that you do not publicly disclose the issue until we have had a chance to address it. Once a fix has been implemented and released, we will publish details of the vulnerability.

## Thank You

We appreciate your help in keeping our project and community safe!
